# Face Recognition Using Quantum Encryption

A forward-looking security application that combines facial recognition technology with quantum-resistant encryption to ensure the safe handling and transmission of biometric data. This project showcases how emerging quantum-secure methods can be integrated with AI-based recognition systems.

## üöÄ Features

- **Face Detection and Recognition** using OpenCV and Dlib.
- **Quantum Encryption Module** simulating post-quantum cryptographic techniques (e.g., lattice-based, QKD simulation).
- **Secure Data Handling** ensuring face data is encrypted before any storage or transfer.
- **Modular Codebase** for easy integration and expansion.

## üß† Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- NumPy
- Simulated Quantum Encryption (Lattice-based or QKD principles)
- (Optional: PyCryptodome for encryption/decryption)
